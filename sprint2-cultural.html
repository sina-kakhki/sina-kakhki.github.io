            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 12, 2021 by <a href="#">Sina</a></p>
    
            <p>Here is my learning plan, I wasn't quite sure how I'm supposed to format it, however I tried to format it to the best sensible way I knew. This page will be constantly updated.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
            <p>I'm hoping to be a senior full-stack developer or the lead developer in a growing IT company in five years.</p>
            
            <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</strong></p>
            <p>I think being able to push through dificulties and obstacles is my main strength, on the other hand finding it hard to focus while studying is my main limit plus being a slow typer is another thing that I have to work on.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong></p>
            <p>Better presentation skills.<p>

            <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong></p>
            <p>I'm very driven, and I'm willing to put in watever I've got to be succeful in this study as I really enjoy how web works and how we can kind of communicate with the computer with different programming languages.
                I'm using toggl track to track my study time and make sure to take breaks.I keep an eye on the slack channel to see if I can help anyone put with any issues, what issues are others facing that I might face later and seek help from other students and my facilitator when possible.
                When I see things are building up I try not to panic and seek help from my classmates and/or facilitator.
                Then I'd review my recent actions to see what have I done wrong that led to this to prevent it in the future.</p>

            <p><Strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</Strong></p>
            <p>During foundation I'll be seeking help on slak channels by putting up a message on foundations channel or contacting my facilitator directly on slack during work hours.</p>

            <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</strong></p>
            <p>the only expectation is to be willing to help and guide as much as possible which I think is happening at the moment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong></p>
            <p>I've made sure that I won't have any other commitments blocking me from studying untill I finish bootcamp.</p>
