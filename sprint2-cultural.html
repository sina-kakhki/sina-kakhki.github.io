            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 12, 2021 by <a href="#">Sina</a></p>
    
            <p>Here is my learning plan, I wasn't quite sure how I was supposed to format it, however I tried to format it in the most sensible way I knew. This page will be constantly updated.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>My long term goal:</strong></p>
            <p>I'm hoping to be a senior full-stack developer or the lead developer in a growing IT company in five years.</p>
            
            <p><strong>My strength and limitation to learning:</strong></p>
            <p>I think being able to push through difficulties and obstacles is my main strength. On the other hand finding it hard to focus while studying is my main limit plus being a slow typer is another thing that I have to work on.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Skills I'd like to develop at EDA:</strong></p>
            <p>Better presentation skills.<p>

            <p><strong>How I will manage my work load in this programme:</strong></p>
            <p>I'm very driven, and I'm willing to put in whatever I've got to do to be successful in this course, as I really enjoy learning about how web works and how we can communicate with the computer with different programming languages.
                I'm using toggl track to track my study time and make sure to take breaks. I'll keep an eye on the slack channel to see if I can help anyone out with any issues and see what issues I might face later on and seek help from other students and my facilitator when possible.
                When I see things are building up I'll try not to panic and seek help from my classmates and facilitator if necessary.
                Then I'll review my recent actions to see what I've done wrong that led to this to prevent it in the future.</p>

            <p><Strong>How I'll seek help in a timely way:</Strong></p>
            <p>During foundation I'll be seeking help on slack channels by putting up a message on the foundation's channel or contacting my facilitator directly on slack during work hours.</p>

            <p><strong>What I expect from the facilitation team:</strong></p>
            <p>The only expectation is to be willing to help and guide as much as possible which I think is happening at the moment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Any other scheduling information:</strong></p>
            <p>I've made sure that I won't have any other commitments blocking me from studying until I finish bootcamp.</p>
