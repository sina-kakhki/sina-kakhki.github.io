        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Who Am I?</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 12, 2021 by <a href="#">Sina</a></p>

        <p>This is my personality, my strength and weaknesses according to the online personality tests that I've done recently!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>According to <em>16personalities.com</em> I have The Advocate (INFJ-A) personality!</p> 
          <p>Advocates are the rarest personality types of all. Still, Advocates leave their mark on the world. They have a deep sense of idealism and integrity, but they aren’t idle dreamers – they take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact.
          Advocates’ unique combination of personality traits makes them complex and quite versatile. For example, Advocates can speak with great passion and conviction, especially when standing up for their ideals. At other times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and understated,
          preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge others.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.”</p>
            <p><strong><em>JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</em></strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/b820faf48ed2d">HERE</a> you can find more information about The Advocate personality type.</p>
        
        <h3>The Advocate's Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <p><strong>Creative:</strong> Advocate personalities enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people they care about. To do this, they draw on their vivid imagination and their strong sense of compassion.
           This can make them excellent counselors and advisors.</p>
        <p><Strong>Insightful:</Strong> Advocates typically strive to move past appearances and get to the heart of things. 
          This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Principled:</strong> People with the Advocate personality type tend to have deeply held beliefs, and their conviction often shines through when they speak or write about subjects that matter to them. Advocates can be compelling and inspiring communicators, with their idealism persuading even the hardest of skeptics.</p>
        <p><strong>Passionate:</strong> Advocates can pursue their ideals with a single-mindedness that may catch others off guard. These personalities rarely settle for “good enough,” and their willingness to disrupt the status quo may not please everyone. That said, Advocates’ passion for their chosen cause is a key aspect of their personality.</p>
        <p><strong>Altruistic:</strong> Advocates generally aim to use their strengths for the greater good – they rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They tend to think about how their actions affect others, and their goal is to behave in a way that will help the people around them and make the world a better place.</p>
        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <p><strong>Sensitive to Criticism:</strong> When someone challenges their principles or values, Advocates may react strongly. People with this personality type can become defensive in the face of criticism and conflict, particularly when it comes to issues that are near to their hearts</p>
        <p><strong>Reluctant to Open Up:</strong> Advocates value honesty, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles. This might also be because they think they need to solve their problems on their own or don’t want to burden other people with their issues. When Advocates don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>Perfectionistic:</strong> The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, an ideal situation is not always possible. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoiding the Ordinary:</strong> Advocate personalities tend to be motivated by a sense of having a greater purpose in life. They might consider it tedious or unnecessary to break their big visions into small, manageable steps. But they may be setting themselves up for frustration if they don’t turn their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists. Without these specifics, their goals may never materialize.</p>
        <p><strong>Prone to Burnout:</strong> Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve may leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t find a way to balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.</p>
        <h3>Workplace Habits</h3>
        <p>Advocates (INFJs) have some specific needs when it comes to a satisfying work environment. People with this personality type want to know that their work helps people and promotes their own personal growth. This means that their work must be in line with their values, principles, and beliefs.</p>
        <p>In the workplace, Advocates tend to thrive when they have opportunities to express their creativity and insight, and they’re especially motivated when they know that what they’re doing has meaning. They also tend to do best when they can ignore workplace politics and hierarchies and simply do what matters to them. Most people with this personality type prefer not to think of themselves as above or below anyone else – no matter where they are on the job ladder.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Advocates are resourceful and creative, and they can find ways to make nearly any position work for them.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">How to make use of your wasted time?</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">February 14, 2021 by <a href="#">Sina</a></p>

        <p>Have you ever thought of a way to make a good use of your wasted time? (i.e driving, doing house chores, cooking etc...) </p>
        <hr>
        <p>I started listening to podcasts about a year ago, and I have realized how much I enjoy them. There is so much out there to learn about! Podcasts offer a vast amount of topics and for the most part, they’re free! There truly is something out there for everyone, even for web developers!</p>
        <p>Podcasts have been around for some time now, but I’ve been late to jump on the train of making them a part of my life. I've personally learnt a lot by listening to podcasts, things like Greek mythology, politics, history, philosophy and technology!</p>
        <p>Many studies have been done on the benefits of podcasts, and what they do for people mentally. One study proves that podcasts stimulate mental imagery more intensely than watching or reading, and cause listeners to have to pay more attention. Since people listen to podcasts instead of watching them, it forces listeners to use their imagination and build the pictures in their mind. Thus, people who listen to podcasts regularly have a stronger and more vivid imagination.</p>
        <p>Podcasts also help us become better listeners. Since they are all about listening, they helps us have a greater appreciation for simply listening. Podcasts allow us to become a part of what we’re listening, and trigger us to listen, pay attention, and then use our imagination to form pictures of the story of what you’re listening to. Podcasts stimulate different parts of the brain, forcing us to actively listen, especially when it’s a topic we’re truly interested in.</p>
        <p>Another great benefit of listening to podcasts is that you can learn new things. Although it is such an obvious, simple idea, it is absolutely worth mentioning! Podcasts come in a variety of lengths, so it’s easy to listen to an episode even if you only have a half hour. If you don’t finish listening in one sitting, they’re always at your disposal on your phone, computer, or tablet to pick back up! They are a great use of time, as they allow you to become more involved and educated in areas that spark your interest.</p>
        <p>There is nothing to lose by making podcasts a part of your regular lifestyle, and everything to gain. Whether you want to learn a new skill, keep up with the news, handle your finances better, or just need a pep talk, there is a podcast out there for you! It’s truly amazing, and we have these resources at our fingertips for absolutely no cost! Find something you’re interested in and if you’re not already start listening today!</p>
        <p>I use <em>Castbox</em> for listening to podcasts which is a free application to use. <em>Spotify</em> is also another popular platform for listening to podcasts. you can easily download them from <em>Google Play Store</em> or <em>Apple Store.</em></p>
        <p>To get you started here are some of my favourite podcasts:</p>
