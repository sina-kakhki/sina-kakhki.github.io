            <p>In this sprint I learnt about Neuroplasticity and The Growth Mindset and how its related to my learning journey.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>The principle of neuroplasticity tells us how our brain goes through the process of learning, that if we confront the challenges of learning through practice we can improve our abilities in that area. For example if you practice a musical instrument over and over you get better and better day by day because the brain develops new neuron pathways as you practice more and more to make accessing the data for playing the instrument easier which will result in being able to play it easier and faster. This means that IQ or intelligence does not play a major role in learning. Its consistency that makes you a better learner.</p> 
            <p>To me this means that in order to be a better programmer I need to practice more. I don't have to be super smart, I just need to be consistent.</p>
            <p><strong>Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity are:</strong></p>
            <p><em>Travelling:</em> this exposes your brain to novel stimuli and new environments, opening up new pathways and activity in the brain;</p>
            <p><em>Using mnemonic devices:</em> memory training can enhance connectivity in the prefrontal parietal network and prevent some age-related memory loss;</p>
            <p><em>Learning a musical instrument:</em> may increase connectivity between brain regions and help form new neural networks;</p>
            <p><em>Non-dominant hand exercises:</em> can form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons;</p>
            <p><em>Reading fiction:</em> increases and enhances connectivity in the brain as well as increasing creativity;</p>
            <p><em>Expanding your vocabulary:</em> activates the visual and auditory processes as well as memory processing;</p>
            <p>Here is a <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/#:~:text=7%20Benefits%20Neuroplasticity%20Has%20on%20the%20Brain,-Building%20on%20the&text=Recovery%20from%20brain%20events%20like,pick%20up%20the%20slack)%3B"><em>link</em></a> to a website that I found very useful for learning more about Neuroplasticity.</p>
            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>By understanding that our brain is not static and our intelligence and learning ability is not fixed, we can be more confident and encouraged about learning. Believing that our brain is malleable and that it can grow, stops us from having a negative fixed mindset that tells us we are not smart enough or we can't learn a specific subject because we're not good enough. Instead, we can develop a growth mindset to believe in our ability of learning. If we work hard and put the energy in we can learn and understand anything!</p>
            <p>Knowing that learning is a journey and how it works really encourages me and gives me hope for success.</p>
            <p>With effort, it's possible to increase intelligence levels, talents, and abilities, therefore I'll not let myself give in to the temptation of giving up.</p>

            <h3>How Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset Has Affected My Learning Plan And Strategies</h3>
            <p>By understanding Neuroplasticity and Growth mindset, I've altered my learning plans a bit, leaving more space for sleep and rest and more emphasis on practice.</p>
