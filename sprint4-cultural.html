            <p>In this sprint I learnt about Neuroplasticity and The Growth Mindset and how its related to your learning journey.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>The principle of neuroplasticity tells us how our brain goes through the process of learning, that if we confront the challenges of learning through practice, the more we do it the better we get at it. For example if you practice playing a musical instrument over and over you get better and better day by day because the brain develops new neuron pathways as you practice more and more to make accessing the data for playing the instrument easier which will result in being able to play it easier and faster. This means that IQ or intelligence does not play a major role in learning. Its consistency that makes you a better learner.</p> 
            <p>To me this means that in order to be a better programmer I only need to practice more and more. I don't have to be super smart, I just need to be consistent.</p>
            <p><strong>Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity are:</strong></p>
            <p><em>Traveling:</em> exposes your brain to novel stimuli and new environments, opening up new pathways and activity in the brain;</p>
            <p></em>Using mnemonic devices:</em> memory training can enhance connectivity in the prefrontal parietal network and prevent some age-related memory loss;</p>
            <p><em>Learning a musical instrument:</em> may increase connectivity between brain regions and help form new neural networks;</p>
            <p><em>Non-dominant hand exercises:</em> can form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons;</p>
            <p><em>Reading fiction:</em> increases and enhances connectivity in the brain;</p>
            <p><em>Expanding your vocabulary:</em> activates the visual and auditory processes as well as memory processing;</p>
            <p>Here is a <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/#:~:text=7%20Benefits%20Neuroplasticity%20Has%20on%20the%20Brain,-Building%20on%20the&text=Recovery%20from%20brain%20events%20like,pick%20up%20the%20slack)%3B"><em>link</em></a> to a website that I found very useful for learning more about Neuroplasticity.</p>
            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>By understanding that our brain is not static and our intelegence and learing ability is not fixed, we can be more confident and encouraged about learning. Believing that our brain is malleable and that it can grow stops us from having a negative fixed mindset that tells us we are not smart enough or we can't learn a specific subject because we're not good enough for that. Instead we can develop a growth mindset to believe in our ability of learning. If we work hard and put the enrgy in we can learn and understand anything!</p>
            <p>Knowing that learning is a journey and how it works really encourages me and gives me hope for success.</p>
            <p>With effort, it's possible to increase intelligence levels, talents, and abilities therefore I'll not let myself to give up to the temptation of giving up.</p>

            <h3>How Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset Affected My Learning Plan And Strategies</h3>
            <p>By understanding Neuroplasticity and Growth mindset, I've altered my learning plans a bit. leaving more space for sleep and rest and more emphasise on practice is my new approach to learning.</p>
