            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 07, 2021 by <a href="#">Sina</a></p>
    
            <p>In this blog post I'm going to go through an overview of the Core learnings I have covered in Foundations.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
            <p>I've learnt about how the brain works in terms of learning, the importance of EQ in comparison with IQ and problem solving. As a result I became more confident about learning programming and coding in general and felt good about my problem solving skills.</p> 
           
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>I believe these 3 elements are the main things that give us direction and drives us. Growing these elements in the right direction would make us a better person. Values, empathy and self awareness are exceptionally important when it comes to programming because of the social aspect of working in a team and the way each team member might approach a problem refers to their level of values, empathy and self awareness.</p>
            
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>The emphasis on it in this course which shows that being a programmer is not only coding.</p>
            
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>For me it was doing the blog posts mostly. The questions sometimes are a bit confusing and kind of vague.</p>
            
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>It looks like there's a shortage of developers with proper soft skills out there which will make developers with this set of skills more likely to land a job in the Tech market.</p>
           
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>I've truely gained by studying the core materials and learnet a lot. Programming is not only codes or the knowledge of coding, if you don't have the right mindset or the right set of skills to comminicate wit your teammates you won't get far as a programmer!</p>
